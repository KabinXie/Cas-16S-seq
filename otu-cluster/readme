The 16S-seq results were processing using VSEARCH pipline and the results were summarized using R package.

Required files:
 Raw sequencing results (available on xx)
 sample information
 root_soil_sample-seq.info.vsearch.csv sample-meta-data
 vsearch_sample_info.csv    information of pair-end sequencing files, used in BASH script

1.Raw data processing and OTU clustering
   vsearch.pipeline.bash  BASH script used in 16S-seq data processing
 
It generates OTU tables and OTUs represent rice Mt-16S-rRNA
   all.otutab100.txt   OTU table
   all.otu100.mt2.txt  mitochondrial OTUs or its nuclear genome homologs

2. R codes to summarizing the OTU table
    vsearch100.analysis.Git-hub.R    The R script i used in analysing the OTU table
    vs.pipline.summary100.csv        summary of reads processing and OTU clustering
